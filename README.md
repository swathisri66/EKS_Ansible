# EKS_Ansible

Part 2: 

Task High-Level Outcome: - Enable us to launch a new microservice(s) in Kubernetes on a highly available and load balanced public cloud environment (eg: AWS) from scratch. 

Problem statement: - Assuming that the highly available and load-balanced cloud environment and Kubernetes cluster exists, you are required to automate the deployment pipeline using Jenkins to containerize and deploy the application to Kubernetes. 

- (Optional) Bonus points, if you are able to automate the highly available and load-balanced cloud environment and Kubernetes cluster creation. A java microservice application example

# Expected outcome:

Use of infrastructure as code tools to (eg: Ansible/Terraform/Packer/Pulumi/Jenkinsfile/k8s manifests) to package, deploy and run the
application. - We expect a production-ready setup. A non-exhaustive list: Ensuring that application is started before it is served with traffic, node affinity /pinning, horizontal pod auto scalers, pod disruption budgets, running applications as non-root, offload TLS at the load balancer/ingress.

Incorporate at least 4 items in this list, Bonus points, if implementing all the items in the list. - All the scripts, configs, playbooks, manifests, etc. in a publicly visible DVCS (eg: GitHub). - A concise README on the Strategy/Architecture along with instructions to recreate the setup.


# Actual outcome
